# About
### This repo contains some of my work from the Break Through Tech AI program. 

- [Define and Solve an ML Problem ](DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb): the final project, which required going through the whole machine learning (ML) life cycle 
    - problem definition, EDA, data preparation, feature engineering, model training and evaluation
    - result: a random random forest model that could predict an Airbnb's price with r^2 = 0.60
- [Model Selection for Logistic Regression ](ModelSelectionForLogisticRegression.ipynb): a lab focused on the evaluation and selection of logistic regression models
    - GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
    - model evaluation using ROC curves and AUC
